abstract: Experience sharing among multiple users in virtual reality (VR) is one of the key applications in next generation wireless systems. In this VR application, one object can be reproduced as a virtual object based on recorded/captured multiple real-time images from multiple observation points. At this time, VR applications require a lot of bandwidth to provide seamless services to users in wireless links, and thus, a certain level of data rates should be maintained. As the number of users increases, the server allocates more data rates to users on top of the limited bandwidth in wireless networks. At this time, users who utilize the VR streaming services will suffer from a lower quality, due to the limited bandwidth. This paper reports the measurement study and also analyzes the fluctuations in terms of the data rates as the number of users increases while sharing point cloud information in real-time authorized reality environments over IEEE 802.11ac wireless networks. Moreover, it measures and analyzes fluctuations in terms of frames-per-second and Jitters, which are practical quality reduction indicators.
